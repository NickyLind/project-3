## Description

_This project will have the user input a number. It will then output a range of numbers starting from 0 to the users number. If the number contains a 1 it will replace it with "Beep". If 2 it will replace it with a "Boop!". If it conatins a 3 it will replace it with a "Won't You Be My Neighbor". The exceptions will be written from least to most important. A three will overwrite a 2 and 1, a 2 will overwrite a 1._
